# Setu

Private remittances on Stellar with compliance-oriented selective disclosure.

Setu is a production-oriented build for private remittance infrastructure on
Stellar. It turns the `soroban-privacy-pools` base implementation into a
remittance-focused flow:

1. Deposit a fixed-value note into a Soroban privacy pool.
2. Withdraw with a Groth16 proof of Merkle membership, nullifier correctness,
   and association-set membership.
3. Generate a selective-disclosure receipt proving that a spent nullifier links
   to a real deposited commitment and that the disclosed amount equals the
   committed value.
4. Let an auditor verify the receipt without learning the note secret.

The product story is cross-border stablecoin remittance: payment privacy for
families and small businesses, with an explicit compliance edge instead of a
black-box mixer.

## What Is New In Setu

This repository is built on top of
[`ymcrcat/soroban-privacy-pools`](https://github.com/ymcrcat/soroban-privacy-pools)
(MIT). The fork already had the base privacy pool, BLS12-381 Groth16 verifier,
Poseidon parity, LeanIMT tree, nullifiers, association-set proof path, and
Circom-to-Soroban artifact conversion.

Setu adds:

- `circuits/disclosure.circom`: selective-disclosure receipt circuit.
- `circuits/disclosure_witness.circom`: helper circuit for deriving receipt
  public signals without a separate Poseidon implementation.
- `circuits/auditor_recompute.circom`: auditor-side recomputation helper.
- `contract/src/disclosure.rs`: `set_disclosure_vk`, `has_disclosure_vk`, and
  `verify_disclosure`.
- Safe proof/public-signal parsing in `libs/zk/src/lib.rs`, including
  canonical BLS12-381 scalar validation.
- Regression tests for malformed input and non-canonical public signals.
- `scripts/live_testnet_e2e.ps1`: reproducible patched testnet flow.

## ZK Statements

### Withdrawal Circuit

`circuits/main.circom` proves:

- The prover knows a deposited note opening.
- The note commitment is included in the pool Merkle tree.
- The nullifier hash is correctly derived.
- The withdrawn value is consistent with the fixed-denomination note.
- The note label is included in the current association set root.

The contract additionally checks:

- The association root in the proof matches the admin-set root.
- The Merkle root in the proof matches the current pool root.
- The nullifier has not already been used.
- The Groth16 proof verifies under the stored withdrawal VK.

### Disclosure Circuit

`circuits/disclosure.circom` uses public signals:

```text
[nullifierHash, commitment, discloseHash, auditorTag]
```

and private witness:

```text
value, label, nullifier, secret, recipientId, purpose, viewingKey
```

It proves:

- `nullifierHash = Poseidon255(nullifier)`.
- `commitment = Poseidon255(value, label, Poseidon255(nullifier, secret))`.
- `discloseHash = Poseidon255(recipientId, purpose, value)`.
- `auditorTag = Poseidon255(viewingKey, nullifierHash)`.

`verify_disclosure` additionally checks:

- `nullifierHash` is already spent in this pool.
- `commitment` is a real deposited leaf in this pool.
- The receipt proof verifies under the disclosure VK.

Important v1 limit: `value` is cryptographically tied to the deposited
commitment. `recipientId` and `purpose` are prover-asserted context hashed into
the receipt; they are not deposit-time committed facts. A production-grade
version should bind those fields into the deposit commitment or verify an
off-ramp signature over them.

## Security Fix From Audit

The audit found a serious cross-layer issue: public signals were parsed into
field elements while set-membership checks used raw bytes. A proof could be
replayed with a non-canonical encoding such as `n + r`, where the pairing
reduces mod `r` but the nullifier set sees a different byte string.

Setu fixes this by:

- Making `Proof::from_bytes` and `PublicSignals::from_bytes` return `Result`.
- Rejecting malformed/truncated proof and public-signal byte arrays.
- Rejecting any BLS12-381 scalar public signal greater than or equal to the
  scalar modulus.
- Returning normal proof-failure responses instead of trapping.

Regression tests cover:

- Truncated proof bytes.
- Truncated public-signal payloads.
- Non-canonical public signals.
- Disclosure verifier malformed inputs.
- Withdraw rejecting non-canonical public signals without storing a nullifier.

## circom2soroban Conversion Audit

`cli/circom2soroban` is the bridge that turns snarkjs Groth16 artifacts into the
byte layout `libs/zk` deserializes on-chain. It has been audited and hardened:

- **snarkjs assumptions**: artifacts must come from **snarkjs 0.7.x** on the
  **BLS12-381** curve (the setup scripts run `snarkjs powersoftau new
  bls12-381`). Default BN254 artifacts are not compatible and are rejected as
  out-of-field values. Each G2 coordinate is read as snarkjs `[c0, c1]`, and the
  projective `z` component of each point is intentionally ignored.
- **Malformed inputs fail clearly**: the CLI now prints a specific error and
  exits non-zero (instead of panicking) for unreadable files, invalid JSON,
  non-decimal or out-of-field coordinates, points that are off-curve or outside
  the prime-order subgroup, an `IC` array whose length does not match
  `nPublic + 1`, non-decimal or oversized public signals, non-canonical public
  signals (`>= r`, which the on-chain verifier would reject), and unknown
  filetypes.
- **Regression tests catch conversion drift** (`cargo test -p circom2soroban`):
  VK, proof, and public-signal outputs are round-tripped back through the real
  `zk` deserializers, plus a hand-derived golden vector pins the public-signal
  byte encoding.

Prototype limit: the point-encoding glue (`g1_from_coords` / `g2_from_coords`)
is duplicated between the converter and `libs/zk/src/test.rs`; the two must stay
in sync, and the round-trip tests exist to catch it if they drift.

## Run Locally

Prerequisites:

- Rust stable.
- Stellar CLI 26.x.
- Node.js.
- `circom` 2.2.x.
- `snarkjs` 0.7.x.
- `circomlib`.

Install JS dependencies from the parent workspace if needed:

```powershell
cd ..
npm install
```

From this repository:

```powershell
cargo test
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release -p privacy-pools
```

Verify the regenerated disclosure proof:

```powershell
npx snarkjs groth16 verify `
  circuits\build_disc\disc_vk.json `
  circuits\build_disc\public.json `
  circuits\build_disc\proof.json
```

Run a fresh patched testnet flow:

```powershell
.\scripts\live_testnet_e2e.ps1
```

The script deploys if no `-ContractId` is supplied. To reuse the current live
contract:

```powershell
.\scripts\live_testnet_e2e.ps1 `
  -ContractId CDXLQFYQJVDXBZDI5QVYRAM5TGPMZQWS424FCQWYVNGSKSSHPU6XXAXT
```

## Authentication

The web app uses Supabase Auth for production sign up, sign in, OAuth redirect,
password reset, session persistence, and sign out. Browser code only receives
the Supabase URL and anon/publishable key. Do not use or expose a service-role
key in `site/`.

Create a Supabase project, enable Email auth, and enable Google/GitHub providers
only after their OAuth client IDs and redirect URLs are configured in Supabase.
Apply the profile table and RLS migration:

```powershell
# Option A: Supabase SQL editor
# Paste supabase/migrations/20260620150000_create_profiles.sql and run it.

# Option B: Supabase CLI, after installing and logging in
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
supabase db push
```

Configure deployment variables:

```text
SETU_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
SETU_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-or-publishable-key>
```

For local static testing, either set those variables before running the site or
copy `site/auth-config.example.js` to `site/auth-config.js` and replace the
placeholder values. `site/auth-config.js` is ignored so real deployment config
does not get committed.

```powershell
cd site
$env:SETU_SUPABASE_URL="https://<project-ref>.supabase.co"
$env:SETU_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<anon-or-publishable-key>"
npm run build
npm run dev
```

If the variables are missing, the auth forms stay disabled and the page shows a
configuration warning instead of opening an unauthenticated workspace.

## Site CI

`.github/workflows/site-ci.yml` runs `npm run smoke` in `site/` on pushes to
`main` and on pull requests. The smoke check verifies that required site files
exist, syntax-checks the site scripts, generates the auth config when
`auth-config.js` is absent (disabled mode when Supabase variables are unset; an
existing local file is preserved, and a file the run generated is removed
afterwards), resolves local references in `index.html`, and boots `server.cjs`
for a request round trip. It is a static and smoke-level
check for this prototype, not a browser test suite. Run it locally with:

```powershell
cd site
npm run smoke
```

## Integration Boundaries

- Fiat on-ramp and INR off-ramp are product-story stubs, not live anchor
  integrations.
- Supabase Auth is wired for real accounts, but a live Supabase project and
  deployment environment variables must be configured before public sign in is
  enabled.
- Testnet native asset is used as the testnet asset.
- The trusted setup is local/staging-only and not production-secure.
- There is no relayer, so gas metadata privacy is future work.

## Future Work

- Bind recipient and purpose into the deposit commitment.
- Add authenticated auditor registry or verifier-key commitments.
- Use per-receipt nonce/key derivation for auditor tags.
- Add relayers for withdrawal gas privacy.
- Support multiple denominations or variable amounts.
- Replace local trusted setup with a real ceremony.
- Integrate real Stellar anchors for SEP-24/SEP-31 production corridors.
