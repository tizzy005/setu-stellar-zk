# Privacy & Compliance Limitations

**Status: prototype.** Setu is an active-development prototype that runs against
the Stellar **testnet**. It is **not audited production software**, it is **not a
regulated money transmitter or remittance provider**, and it is **not legal,
compliance, or financial advice**. Read this document before relying on any Setu
claim in the product story, README, or landing page.

This document is the counterpart to the product story in the README. The story
is about what Setu is *building toward*; this page is about what the code
actually proves today, and what it does **not** prove.

---

## What the Proof Proves

Setu has two proofs, verified by the Soroban contract:

### 1. Withdrawal proof (`circuits/main.circom`, verified in `withdraw`)

A valid withdrawal proof, combined with the contract's own checks, proves that:

- The prover knows the opening of a deposited note: `label`, `value`,
  `nullifier`, and `secret` (`circuits/commitment.circom`).
- The note commitment is a leaf in the pool's Merkle tree (`stateRoot`
  matches the commitment's computed Merkle path).
- `nullifierHash` is correctly derived from the note's `nullifier`
  (`nullifierHash = Poseidon(nullifier)`).
- The withdrawn value does not exceed the committed value (range-checked).
- The note's `label` is a member of the current association set
  (`associationRoot`).

The contract additionally enforces, independent of the proof:

- The `associationRoot` in the proof equals the admin-set root.
- The Merkle `stateRoot` in the proof equals the contract's current pool root.
- The `nullifierHash` has not been used before (double-spend prevention).
- The Groth16 proof verifies under the stored withdrawal verification key.
- The contract transfers exactly the fixed denomination (`FIXED_AMOUNT`).

### 2. Selective-disclosure receipt (`circuits/disclosure.circom`, verified in `verify_disclosure`)

A valid receipt proof (public signals
`[nullifierHash, commitment, discloseHash, auditorTag]`) proves that:

- `nullifierHash = Poseidon255(nullifier)` for a private `nullifier` the
  prover knows.
- `commitment = Poseidon255(value, label, Poseidon255(nullifier, secret))`
  — i.e. the prover knows the full opening of the deposited note, including
  `value`.
- `discloseHash = Poseidon255(recipientId, purpose, value)` — the disclosed
  amount, recipient tag, and purpose are the exact values hashed into the
  receipt.
- `auditorTag = Poseidon255(viewingKey, nullifierHash)` — the receipt is bound
  to a viewing key the prover knows.

`verify_disclosure` additionally checks, against the contract's own state:

- `nullifierHash` is an **already-spent** withdrawal in **this** pool.
- `commitment` is a **real deposited leaf** in **this** pool.
- The receipt proof verifies under the disclosure verification key.

So a receipt proves: *"the on-chain withdrawal identified by this spent
nullifier spent this exact deposit leaf, whose committed value is the amount
disclosed in this receipt."*

## What the Proof Does Not Prove

The following are **not** established by any Setu proof. This is the part that
matters most for compliance claims.

- **Recipient and purpose are not deposit-time facts.** In v1, `recipientId`
  and `purpose` are *prover-asserted context* hashed into the receipt at
  withdrawal time. The circuit does not prove they were committed when the
  deposit was made. A production version must bind these fields into the
  deposit commitment or verify an off-ramp signature over them.
- **The auditor tag is not an authenticated identity.** `auditorTag` lets a
  holder of the matching `viewingKey` recognize a receipt intended for them.
  It does not prove the auditor is a licensed or registered entity, and it is
  not a verifiable credential.
- **Nothing links the receipt to a real-world person.** No proof connects the
  deposit or withdrawal to a KYC'd identity, a bank account, or a regulated
  off-ramp. The proofs are purely cryptographic statements about on-chain
  state.
- **The receipt does not prove the off-chain payout happened.** A valid
  receipt proves the disclosed amount equals the committed value of a real
  deposit; it says nothing about whether fiat was actually delivered to the
  recipient.
- **Privacy is limited, not absolute.** The disclosure receipt deliberately
  links `nullifierHash <-> commitment`, a link the pool otherwise keeps
  unlinkable. `verify_disclosure` on-chain publishes that link to **everyone**
  who reads the ledger — it is not a private channel. For a single regulator,
  prefer off-chain verification. The withdrawal proof itself does not reveal
  which deposit was spent, but it does not hide the withdrawing address, the
  amount, or the fact that a withdrawal occurred.
- **No gas/network-metadata privacy.** There is no relayer, so the sender's
  network identity is visible in transaction metadata. This is explicitly
  future work.
- **The circuit has a zero-root association bypass.** In
  `circuits/main.circom`, the association-membership constraint is skipped when
  `associationRoot == 0` (a backward-compatibility path). The contract blocks
  this on-chain by refusing withdrawals until a non-zero association root is
  set, so live withdrawals always carry a real root — but the circuit alone
  would accept the bypass, and the pattern should be removed before any
  production deployment.

## Anchor and Off-Ramp Status (Mock)

The **on-ramp (USDC → pool) and off-ramp (pool → INR) corridors are
product-story stubs, not live anchor integrations.**

- Fiat on-ramp and INR off-ramp are not wired to any Stellar anchor
  (SEP-24/SEP-31) or fiat rails. The landing page and dashboard present a
  "Bob INR wallet" corridor as illustrative UI, not as a working corridor.
- The testnet asset is the Stellar **native asset (XLM)** used as a stand-in
  for USDC; there is no USDC or stablecoin integration on testnet or mainnet.
- There is no deposit-taker, no beneficiary bank account, and no settlement
  guarantee. "1,000 XLM" and "INR" figures in the UI are demo data.
- `Supabase Auth` is wired for real accounts, but public sign-in only works
  once a live Supabase project and deployment environment variables are
  configured; until then the auth forms stay disabled.

Anyone evaluating a corridor should assume **zero** production connectivity
exists today.

---

## Trusted Setup

The Groth16 trusted setup is **local/staging-only and not production-secure**:

- The powers-of-tau and circuit-specific ceremony artifacts are generated
  locally by the setup scripts, not by a public ceremony with independent
  participants.
- A compromised toxic waste would allow forging proofs (and therefore forged
  receipts). Do not treat the current setup as a commitment to soundness in
  production.
- Replacing it with a real ceremony is listed as future work.

---

## Legal Caveats

- **Not regulated.** Setu is not a money transmitter, a remittance service, a
  bank, or any kind of licensed financial institution. Nothing in the product
  story, README, or site is an offer to provide regulated services.
- **Not audited.** The codebase has not passed a professional security or
  cryptography audit. The audit mentioned in the README was an internal review
  of a specific cross-layer encoding issue, not a full production audit.
- **Marketing claims are aspirational.** Landing-page statements such as
  "Built for Regulatory Standards" and "meet KYC/AML compliance checks
  on-chain seamlessly" describe a design goal, not a current capability or a
  compliance attestation. See "What the Proof Does Not Prove" above.
- **No legal/compliance/financial advice.** Any use of Setu in a regulated
  context requires qualified legal and compliance review in the relevant
  jurisdictions, and the operator remains responsible for their own
  obligations (KYC/AML/CFT, data protection, licensing).
- **Testnet funds only.** Deployments and transactions are on the Stellar
  testnet with no real value. Nothing in this repository should be used to
  move real funds.

---

## Path To Production

The following gaps would need to close before Setu could responsibly be
considered for anything beyond a prototype:

1. Bind `recipientId`/`purpose` into the deposit commitment (or verify an
   off-ramp signature over them).
2. Replace the local trusted setup with a real, publicly-audited ceremony.
3. Remove the zero-root association bypass from the withdrawal circuit.
4. Integrate real Stellar anchors (SEP-24/SEP-31) and a real off-ramp.
5. Add relayers so transaction metadata does not leak the sender.
6. Obtain a professional security and cryptography audit.
7. Engage qualified counsel for licensing and KYC/AML/CFT design in each
   operating jurisdiction.

Until then, treat every claim in the product story as a prototype claim, not a
production capability.
